## Conclusions

The Conformal Prediction applied to the regression task yielded the following insights and conclusions:

1. **Coverage Probability**: 
   1. The prediction intervals constructed using Conformal Prediction exhibited a coverage probability of 96%. This indicates that the majority of the prediction intervals contained the true target values, demonstrating the reliability of the uncertainty estimates provided by the model.
    
2. **Areas for Improvement**:
   - **Prediction Interval** Sometimes on the lower end interval calculation negative values of gas production are displayed when in practicality this is not possible. There's more room for improvemente in the development of this solution.
   - **Additional Context**: Incorporating more contextual information about the data, such as the time frame, domain-specific knowledge, or the process of data extraction, could enhance model performance.
   - **Feature Engineering**: Exploring more sophisticated feature engineering techniques or deriving new features based on domain expertise could lead to improved predictive performance.
   - **Data Augmentation**: Expanding the dataset through data augmentation techniques or collecting additional data could provide the model with more information to learn from, potentially improving its predictive capabilities.

3. **Addressing Big Errors**:
   - The presence of significant errors, particularly at the higher end of the feature domain, suggests that the model struggles with regions of sparse or scattered data. To address this, efforts should be directed towards collecting more data in these areas or implementing data augmentation techniques to augment the existing dataset.

4. **Further Model Iterations**:
   - Iterative model development and refinement should be pursued to enhance predictive performance.
   - For simplicity and speediness, Random Forest was the model chosen. Surely, experimenting with different modeling approaches, hyperparameters could lead to better model generalization and robustness.
